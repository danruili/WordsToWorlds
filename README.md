Our work utilizes Large Language Models and generative tools to automate and refine digital storytelling.

Employing a top-down story drafting and bottom-up asset generation approach, this framework tackles key issues such as manual intervention, interactive scene orchestration, and narrative consistency. This framework enables efficient production of interactive and consistent digital storytellings across multiple modalities, democratizing content creation and enhancing engagement.
